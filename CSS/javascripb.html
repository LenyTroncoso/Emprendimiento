            <p>JavaScript Basics JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in
                a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.

                    <span class="hola"> 
                                    <b> 
                                        <u>Variable Declaration</u>
                                    </b>
                                </span> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified
                    with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span>var x; </span>/
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="hola">

                            <u>Variable Assignment</u> 
                        </b>  
                    </span>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span>var x = 10;</span>
                </li>
                <li>

                                    <u>Data Types</u> 
                                </b>
                            </span>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>false</span>                    ; null - <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159</span>; String- <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array <span>[1, 'Coding, 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span>{first_name: 'Jane', last name: ' Doe')</span>                    </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="hola">
                                <b>
                                    <u>Conditionals</u>
                                </b>
                            </span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements
                    in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span>else if </span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is
                    false; <span> else </span> we execute this block of code; </li>

                <li>
                    <span class="hola">
                                <b>
                                    <u>Loops </u>
                                </b>
                            </span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile,
                    well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>

                <li>
                    <span class="hola">
                                    <b>
                                        <u>Function </u>
                                    </b>
                                    </span> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together
                    a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so
                    lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
